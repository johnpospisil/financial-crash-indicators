    "Here's a structured series of prompts to build your recession indicator dashboards:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 1: Project Setup & Data Infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 1:** \"Create a Python project structure for the recession dashboard with folders for data collection, processing, visualization, and web app. Include a requirements.txt with pandas, yfinance, fredapi, plotly, dash, jupyter, and requests.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 2:** \"Create a configuration file for API keys (FRED API key for economic data) and data source endpoints. Include documentation on how to obtain free API keys.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 2: Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 3:** \"Create a data fetcher module that pulls the following data from FRED API:\n",
    "- 10Y-2Y and 10Y-3M Treasury spreads (DGS10, DGS2, DGS3MO)\n",
    "- Unemployment rate and Sahm Rule index\n",
    "- Initial jobless claims (4-week moving average)\n",
    "- Corporate credit spreads (BAA10Y, AAA10Y)\n",
    "- Include historical data back to 1980.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 4:** \"Extend the data fetcher to collect:\n",
    "- Leading Economic Index (LEI)\n",
    "- ISM Manufacturing PMI\n",
    "- GDP growth (quarterly)\n",
    "- Consumer Confidence Index (University of Michigan)\n",
    "- Housing starts and building permits\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 5:** \"Add a data caching mechanism that stores fetched data locally with timestamps, and only re-fetches data that's older than 1 day (for daily indicators) or 1 week (for weekly/monthly indicators).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 3: Indicator Calculation & Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 6:** \"Create a module that calculates recession probability signals:\n",
    "- Yield curve inversion detection and duration\n",
    "- Sahm Rule trigger detection\n",
    "- Threshold analysis for each indicator based on historical recession patterns\n",
    "- Generate a composite recession risk score (0-100)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 7:** \"Build a historical recession marker dataset using NBER recession dates, and create functions to overlay recession periods on all visualizations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 4: Jupyter Notebook Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 8:** \"Create an interactive Jupyter notebook dashboard with:\n",
    "- Auto-refresh cell that fetches latest data\n",
    "- Time series plots for each core indicator (yield curve, unemployment, jobless claims, credit spreads)\n",
    "- Visual recession period shading\n",
    "- Current values with color-coded risk levels (green/yellow/red)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 9:** \"Extend the notebook with:\n",
    "- Secondary indicator visualizations\n",
    "- A composite risk gauge/scorecard\n",
    "- Historical comparison tables showing 'current value vs pre-recession averages'\n",
    "- Summary statistics and trend analysis\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 5: Web Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 10:** \"Create a Dash/Plotly web application with the same visualizations as the notebook:\n",
    "- Multi-page layout (Overview, Core Indicators, Secondary Indicators, Historical Analysis)\n",
    "- Responsive design\n",
    "- Auto-refresh functionality (checks for new data on page load)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 11:** \"Add interactive features to the web dashboard:\n",
    "- Date range selectors\n",
    "- Indicator comparison tools\n",
    "- Downloadable data exports\n",
    "- Alert thresholds with notifications\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 6: Automation & Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 12:** \"Create a data update script that can run as a cron job or scheduled task to fetch fresh data daily and update the cache.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 13:** \"Add deployment configuration for the web dashboard:\n",
    "- Docker container setup\n",
    "- Instructions for hosting on Heroku/Render/Railway\n",
    "- Environment variable configuration\n",
    "- GitHub Actions workflow for automated data updates\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 14:** \"Add forecasting capabilities using simple models (ARIMA, exponential smoothing) to project indicator trends 3-6 months forward.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 15:** \"Create an email/SMS notification system that alerts when key indicators cross recession warning thresholds.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**To get started, simply give me Prompt 1** and I'll begin building. We can proceed sequentially or skip to specific prompts based on your priorities. Would you like to start with Prompt 1?"
